# Planner Application
## Description

This app allows users to view and plan their schedule for the current day. The calender presents timeblocks for standard business hours and color-codes them based on past, present, and future. Users can enter events for specific timeblocks by clicking on them and saving the event in local storage by clicking the save button. The app also persists events between page refreshes.


## Challenges
I learned a lot from this assignment about using external resources like moment.js to complete the requirements. I found that using jquery made the code much more concise, reducing what would have been around 100 lines of code to almost half using plain JavaScript. I also gained an understanding of local storage and how it can be used to access saved information at any time. Overall, this assignment was a valuable learning experience.


## Things I learned

This assignment introduced me to jquery, local storage, and moment.js and how they can be used to create a dynamic and user-friendly webpage. I learned how these tools can be combined to create a webpage that allows users to interact with it and use it as a tool for organization and success. The ability to schedule and record events hour by hour and access that information for later use or reference can be beneficial for anyone looking to improve their organization skills.
